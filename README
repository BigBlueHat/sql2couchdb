sql2couchdb
===========

At the moment this project is a proof of concept, but should quickly develop
into a usable application. Even as a proof of concept it is useful, though
buggy and at times slow.

The idea is that you feed it a JSON object that has an SQL SELECT statement and
the JSON that you want your documents to look like. The values of your
document's properties map to the column headers that you SELECT from your
tables.

This allows you to easily migrate data stored in SQL to CouchDB JSON documents.

Currently only MySQL is supported, but support for other SQL stores is planned.

Compatability
-------------

PHP 5 (requires MySQL libraries)

Running It
----------

sql2couchdb takes all of the connection info on the command line, with the last
argument being the path to the JSON file. For example,
 
./sql2couchdb.php --mysql-user=john --mysql-pass=l337 --mysql-db=s2c --couchdb-db=s2c example.json

Host and port information defaults to 127.0.0.1 and the server's default port.
CouchDB does not require authentication information unless your database
requires an account to write.

See example.json for an example of how to format your JSON file.
